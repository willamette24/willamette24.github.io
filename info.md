Every runner will receive a cool tshirt and a pint cup adorned with our race logo _(coming soon)_. We are working on identifying an appropriately cool award for male and female overall winners! 

# Course
**Map coming soon**

The course is a 1 mile loop, with one very small ~5ft tall hill, consisting of 50% trail and 50% paved path. The race is held in a public park which will be open for public use throughout the day. The course path and trail is wide enough for our race and the general public to share, however, please understand that there may be local runners/walkers using some portion of the race course on race day.

The race is a sanctioned USATF event, and we intend on having the course measured and certified in early February. We are also going to apply for IAU bronze labelling after our national certifications are complete.. Come out and set a personal, age, or world record with confidence in our event and course!
